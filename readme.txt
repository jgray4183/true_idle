True Idle is an Idle Game with no imputs, it just automatically runs in terminal
Some might say thats not a game, I say number go up

Points are made by genirators that automatically unlock and buy as the game gose on, there are a few upgrades that buy when avalable, every so often a random event will happen
When a genirator reaches a goal amount it pristeges, resets to 0 and starts buying again with a higher cost and output

The game will save and exit if stopped with a keyboard interupt (CTRL + C)
